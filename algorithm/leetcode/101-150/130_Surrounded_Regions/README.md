# 130. Surrounded Regions

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.


### Example 1:

![image description](xogrid.jpeg)

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

### Constraints:

* m == board.length
* n == board[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 200
* board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

> 130. 被围绕的区域

给你一个 m x n 的矩阵 board ，由若干字符 'X' 和 'O' ，找到所有被 'X' 围绕的区域，并将这些区域里所有的'O' 用 'X' 填充。


示例 1：

```
输入：board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
输出：[["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
解释：被围绕的区间不会存在于边界上，换句话说，任何边界上的'O'都不会被填充为'X'。 任何不在边界上，或不与边界上的'O'相连的'O'最终都会被填充为'X'。如果两个元素在水平或垂直方向相邻，则称它们是“相连”的。
```

示例 2：

```
输入：board = [["X"]]
输出：[["X"]]
```
